# evolving-games

Collection of scripts implementing models from papers on evolutionary game theory.

Code in Python is organized in three directories:
- `games` includes implementation of some games used as the model of dynamics, eg. Prisoner's dillema,
- `models` contains implementation of various models,
- `varia` contains some scripts related to network properties.

NetLogo models are in `netlogo` directory.


# Requirements

## For running Python simulations
Graphs are implemented using [NetworkX](http://networkx.github.io/). [Numpy](https://www.numpy.org/) and [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) are also required.

Agent based models in python are implemented using [Mesa](https://github.com/projectmesa).

## For running NetLogo
NetLogo is a multi-agent programmable modeling environment. It can be obtained from <a href="http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/">NetLogo hompepage</a>. Models can be also run via <a href="http://www.netlogoweb.org/">NetLogo Web</a>.
