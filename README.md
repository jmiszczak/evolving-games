# evolving-games

Collection of scripts implementing models from papers on evolutionary game theory.

Files are organized in three directories:
- `games` includes implementation of some games used as the model of dynamics, eg. Prisoner's dillema,
- `models` contains implementation of various models,
- `varia` contains some scripts related to network properties.

# Requirements

Graphs are implemented using [NetworkX](http://networkx.github.io/). [Numpy](https://www.numpy.org/) and [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) are also required.

Agent based models are implemented using [Mesa](https://github.com/projectmesa).

# Relevant papers

Models implemented in this repo were described in the following papers.
