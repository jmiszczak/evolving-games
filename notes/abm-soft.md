# Environements


## NetLogo

https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/

NetLogo is a multi-agent programmable modeling environment. It is used by many hundreds of thousands of students, teachers, and researchers worldwide. It also powers HubNet participatory simulations. It is authored by Uri Wilensky and developed at the CCL. You can download it free of charge. You can also try it online through NetLogo Web. 

## Repast

https://repast.github.io/

The Repast Suite is a family of advanced, free, and open source agent-based modeling and simulation platforms that have been under continuous development for over 20 years:

Repast Simphony is a richly interactive and easy to learn Java-based modeling toolkit that is designed for use on workstations and small computing clusters. Repast Simphony is provided as an Eclipse update site for users who wish to install Repast into Eclipse directly. This is also the required installation process for linux or any other system for which an automated installer is not available. The update site can also be installed into Eclipse on a Windows or macOS system. 

Repast for High Performance Computing is a lean and expert-focused C++-based distributed agent-based modeling toolkit that is designed for use on large computing clusters and supercomputers. 

Repast for Python is a Python-based distributed agent-based modeling toolkit, intended to provide an easier on-ramp for researchers from diverse scientific communities to apply large-scale distributed ABM methods.

### Instaltion process

On GNU/Linux systme, Repast installation is done via Eclipse software management system. Examples are not included in the instalation, but they can be easilty imported using the IDE. 


## MASON


https://cs.gmu.edu/~eclab/projects/mason/

https://github.com/eclab/mason


MASON is a fast agent-based simulation library core in Java, designed to be the foundation for large custom-purpose Java simulations, and also to provide more than enough functionality for many lightweight simulation needs. MASON contains both a model library and an optional suite of visualization tools in 2D and 3D. 

## Evolplex

https://evoplex.org/

Evoplex is a free and open-source software. We encourage you to join the community and help us to improve Evoplex. There are many ways that you can contribute, beyond writing code.


## Simona

https://github.com/ie3-institute/simona

The agent-based simulation environment SIMONA provides a simulation toolbox to run and implement large-scale agent-based electricity grid simulations with focus on distribution grids. As a result, close-to-reality time series are generated from various system participants and grid assets that can be used to analyze a given power grid. Application cases are for example distribution grid planning purposes but also flexibility analysis or coupled sector interdependency analysis. The framework contains several out-of-the-box available models for a wide variety of grid participants as well as their operational behavior.

## StarLogo

https://www.slnova.org/

StarLogo Nova is an agent-based game and simulation programming environment that combines an easy-to-use blocks-based programming language with a powerful simulation engine and 3D renderer.

## GAMA

GAMA (GIS Agent-based Modeling Architecture) is a modeling and simulation development environment for building spatially explicit agent-based simulations. GAMA provides a simulation platform with a complete modelling and simulation integrated development environment (IDE) for building spatially explicit agent-based simulations.

GAMA is based on domain-specific language GAML (GAma Modeling Language). GAML was insired by Java and Smaltalk. It is agent-based and can be used to build simulaiton. 

# Programming libraries

## MESA (Python)

https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa/


Mesa allows users to quickly create agent-based models using built-in core components (such as spatial grids and agent schedulers) or customized implementations; visualize them using a browser-based interface; and analyze their results using Python's data analysis tools. Its goal is to be the Python 3-based alternative to NetLogo, Repast, or MASON.


## Agents.jl (Julia)

https://github.com/JuliaDynamics/Agents.jl

Agents.jl is a Julia framework for agent-based modeling (ABM). All further information about Agents.jl are provided in the docs.

## AgentPy (Python)

https://github.com/JoelForamitti/agentpy

AgentPy is an open-source library for the development and analysis of agent-based models in Python. The framework integrates the tasks of model design, interactive simulations, numerical experiments, and data analysis within a single environment. The package is optimized for interactive computing with IPython, IPySimulate, and Jupyter.


## MaDKIT (Java)

https://github.com/fmichel/MaDKit

MaDKit is an open source multiagent-based software written in Java.

MaDKit 5 is designed as a lightweight Java library for developing distributed applications and simulations using the multiagent paradigm.


## OpenABL

https://github.com/OpenABL/OpenABL

OpenABL is a work-in-progress domain-specific language for agent based simulations. It it designed to compile to multiple backends targeting different computing architectures, including single CPUs, GPUs and clusters.

# Comercial systems

## AnyLogic

https://www.anylogic.com/

AnyLogic is a multimethod simulation modeling tool developed by The AnyLogic Company (former XJ Technologies).[4] It supports agent-based, discrete event, and system dynamics simulation methodologies. IT can be run on Wikndows, macOs, and GNU/Linux. There is a free version available fro personal use.
